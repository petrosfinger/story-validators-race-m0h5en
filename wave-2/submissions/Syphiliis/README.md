## Contributions and Experience
As the co-founder of EasyNode, I have gained extensive experience in problem-solving and building infrastructure that supports efficient node management. My work includes ensuring the smooth operation of nodes across multiple blockchains, as well as resolving technical issues that arise during node setup and maintenance.

I am also passionate about sharing knowledge with the wider community. I regularly write guides in both French and English on Medium (you can find them [here](https://medium.com/@breizh-node)) to make technical aspects of node management more accessible to a broad audience. Additionally, I create video tutorials on YouTube to further support blockchain enthusiasts.
