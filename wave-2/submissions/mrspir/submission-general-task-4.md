Story Protocol is building a diverse and powerful ecosystem aimed at revolutionizing the management and exploitation of intellectual property (IP) in the digital age. This ecosystem page showcases the richness of projects and tools being developed on the Story Protocol platform.

### Key Highlights:


1. **Community Scale**
2. **Development Activity**
3. **Exploration Tools**: Story Explorer & Faucet allow users to easily participate in the ecosystem.
4. **Notable Projects**

In the future, we are developing individual profiles for each project, including basic information, mini-guild, mini-docs, and general project updates.


## Story RPC/API Infrastructure Tracking - [IPWORLD.io/RPC-API](https://ipworld.io/rpc-api)

This page provides an overview of the performance and status of RPC endpoints within the Story Protocol ecosystem.

### Main Features:


1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays status, block height, and latency of verified RPC endpoints.
   Performance Comparison: Latency trend charts and block height comparisons facilitate easy assessment of different RPC providers' performance.
2. **RPC Ranking Table**: Detailed listing of RPC endpoints with information on block height, latency, and status.

For future expansion, we are developing additional categories including:

* Tracking Websocket/ API/ Cosmos RPC
* Validator/ Infrastructure Provider Profile: helps check their infrastructure history including block latency, RPC latency with up to 30 days of monitoring for better oversight

### Significance and Benefits:

* **Transparency**: Provides clear information on infrastructure performance for the community and developers.
* **Reliability**: Helps users choose the most reliable RPC endpoints for their applications, as well as helping developers select RPC provided by Validators to save infrastructure costs compared to third-party providers.
* **Continuous Improvement**: Encourages healthy competition among RPC providers, leading to improved service quality.
* **Infrastructure Enhancement**: Optimizes RPC performance and reduces latency to support more demanding applications.

**Additionally, with a clear vision for Story Protocol, we are focusing on developing more features for IPWorld and will be launching soon.**
