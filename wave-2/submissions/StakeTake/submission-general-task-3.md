## Key Features

### System Metrics
- **CPU Usage:** Tracks the CPU load on validator nodes to identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Memory Usage:** Monitors memory allocations and consumption, including Go process allocations and system memory utilization.
- **Disk I/O:** Displays disk input/output operations to assess storage performance.

### Blockchain Metrics
- **Current Chain Height:** Shows the latest block height, monitoring network progression and synchronization status.
- **Transaction Count:** Indicates the number of transactions processed in a given timeframe.
- **Gas Used:** Measures total gas consumption, providing insights into network utilization and congestion levels.

### Consensus Metrics
- **Current Consensus Round:** Indicates the block agreement process stage.
- **Current Consensus Step:** Provides detailed insights into the block validation process.
- **Consensus Block Interval (95th Percentile):** Represents the time interval between blocks, indicating network latency.

### Validator Monitoring
- **Validator List:** A table detailing each validator's performance and status:
  - **Moniker:** The validator's display name.
  - **Operator Address:** Clickable links redirecting to the validator's page on the explorer.
  - **Status:** Indicates validator status (active, warning, inactive) using color codes.
  - **Tokens:** Total tokens delegated to the validator.
  - **Delegator Shares:** Indicates the level of support.
  - **Commission Rate:** The commission percentage charged by the validator.
  - **Jailed:** Indicates whether the validator is jailed.

### Network Metrics
- **Network Traffic (Ingress/Egress):** Monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Connected Peers:** Displays active peer connections.

### Application Metrics
- **Go Memory Allocated:** Tracks memory usage by Go processes.
- **Garbage Collection Duration:** Measures time for garbage collection processes.
- **ABCI Commit Method Execution Time:** Monitors ABCI commit method execution time.

### Geth Metrics
- **Geth Information:** Provides version and configuration details of the Geth client.
- **Database State:** Shows read/write operations and the state of Ethereum database health.
- **Downloader Metrics:** Tracks data download efficiency.
- **Fetcher Metrics:** Monitors transaction fetcher integrity and propagation.

## Functional Features
- **Clickable Explorer Links:** Quick access to validator information via the "Validator List" table.
- **Thresholds and Color Indicators:** Immediate visual cues for health and performance (green for optimal, orange for warnings, red for critical issues).
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Configured alerts for deviations or issues, ensuring prompt responses.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filters specific validators for targeted monitoring and analysis.

## Technical Details
### Data Sources
- **Prometheus:** Primary data source collecting and aggregating metrics.
- **JSON API:** Fetches validator-specific information.

### Data Transformations
- **Extract Fields:** Converts JSON responses into a tabular format.
- **Filter Fields by Name:** Displays only relevant data fields.
- **Organize:** Renames and structures fields for readability.

### Visualization
- **Tables:** Displays detailed validator information.
- **Time Series Graphs:** Tracks metric trends over time.
- **Gauges and Status Indicators:** Provides quick visual assessments of system health.

### Technologies and Plugins Used
- **Grafana:** Visualization platform for dashboard management.
- **Prometheus:** Monitoring toolkit for data collection.
- **marcusolsson-json-datasource:** Plugin for JSON API integration.
- **Font Awesome:** Icon toolkit for visual enhancement.
