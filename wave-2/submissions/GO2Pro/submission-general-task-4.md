# Story Peers Manager

This script is designed to ensure that a blockchain node remains synchronized with the master node by monitoring its block height.

If the local node falls behind the master by a predefined number of blocks, specified by BLOCK_DIFF_THRESHOLD, the script fetches peer data from other nodes to update the local nodeâ€™s peer list. This helps the node catch up if it's lagging because its current peers are not providing the latest block data.

The goal is to keep the node well-connected and up-to-date with the network to maintain optimal performance and reliability.

**Technical Description:**

- `BLOCK_DIFF_THRESHOLD`: This sets the number of blocks by which if our node is lagging behind the master node, it will trigger an update of the peers to help catch up.

**Key Components of the Script:**
- Fetching Block Information: Retrieves and compares block heights from the local node and the master server.
- Peer Management: Updates peer information if the local node is significantly behind.
- Service Management: Manages the node service based on syncing needs.
- Logging and Record Keeping: Maintains logs and records of block height differences.
- Error Handling: Manages errors related to connectivity and data fetching.

## Quick Start

```bash
wget -q -O story_peers_setup.sh https://api.go2pro.xyz/story_peers_setup.sh && sudo chmod +x story_peers_setup.sh && ./story_peers_setup.sh
```
