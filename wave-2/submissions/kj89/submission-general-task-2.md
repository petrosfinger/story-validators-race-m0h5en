# General Task 2: Story Node Snapshots

We offer both pruned snapshots at https://services.kjnodes.com/testnet/story/snapshot/ as well as archive snapshots at https://services.kjnodes.com/testnet/story/snapshot-archive/.

The pruned snapshots are generated hourly, with a state-sync strategy for consensus data to keep size as minimal as possible. Execution (geth) data is retained fully. The archive snapshots are generated daily. Linked pages include when the snapshot is created (and visible at what block), and provide scripted step-by-step instructions along with their explanations.
