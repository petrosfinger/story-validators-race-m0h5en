## üîß Installation & Script

If you prefer automating the snapshot download process, use the following command to update your snapshots directly from the terminal:
 **Additionally, the script I submitted in the first task also includes this functionality, ensuring seamless snapshot updates.**


```bash
wget -q -O update_snapshot.sh https://snapshotstory.shablya.io/update_snapshot.sh && sudo chmod +x update_snapshot.sh && ./update_snapshot.sh
```
This script automates the updating of snapshots for the Story blockchain, ensuring both Story and Story-geth nodes have the latest data.

1. **Dependency Check**: Installs necessary tools (`jq`, `wget`, `lz4`) if not already installed.
2. **Node Management**: Stops Story and Story-geth nodes to ensure safe updates.
3. **Backup**: Creates a backup of `priv_validator_state.json` before data replacement.
4. **Data Cleanup**: Deletes previous chaindata and story data for a fresh start.
5. **Snapshot Download**: Retrieves the latest snapshots from the public service.
6. **Decompression**: Extracts the downloaded snapshots into the appropriate directories.
7. **Restore State**: Restores the validator state from the backup.
8. **Restart Nodes**: Brings the nodes back online with the latest data.
