# [STORY TOOLS](https://story-tools.stavr.tech/ )

🚀 We provide the community with a range of services that we hope will be useful.🚀     \
🔗**Snapshot** - Archive and Pruned. Save your space or, on the contrary, keep the entire blockchain with you! \
📊**Live Peers** - Update your peers and maintain good uptime! \
💡**RPC Scanner** - Regularly updated list of available RPCs (archived and not so much) \
📚**Upgrade Page** - Always be aware of how much time is left until the next update. (Update instructions are included.) \
🌐**Story Map** - Observe the geography of nodes and validators in the world of Testnet Story!

## I suggest we sort out all these points.
