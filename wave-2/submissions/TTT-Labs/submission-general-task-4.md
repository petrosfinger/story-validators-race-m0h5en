## TTT VN Public Good Services Documentation

At **TTT Labs**, we take immense pride in our mission to empower and support the **Story blockchain community**. Our goal is to provide validators, developers, and stakeholders with essential tools and services that enhance **network performance, stability, and decentralization**. These offerings reflect our commitment to maintaining high standards and ensuring that every validator has the resources necessary to thrive. Below is a detailed overview of the suite of services we offer.

----------

### **1. RPC and API Services**

Our **public RPC and API endpoints** allow validators and developers to interact seamlessly with the Story blockchain network. These endpoints ensure low-latency connectivity and reliable query responses, which are essential for:

-   **Node synchronization** with the latest blockchain state.
-   **Querying on-chain data** for dApps and external tools.
-   **Validator management** with fast and secure access to RPC services.

üöÄ **[API and Seed Configuration](https://services.tienthuattoan.com/testnet/story/peers-seeds)**

----------

### **2. Live Peers and Seed Nodes**

Maintaining high availability in a blockchain network requires reliable **peers and seed nodes**. We provide a **comprehensive list of live peers and seed nodes**, ensuring validators can easily connect and stay in sync with the network. This helps:

-   **Improve peer connectivity** and prevent network isolation.
-   **Ensure decentralized participation**, strengthening network security.

----------

### **3. State Synchronization and Snapshots**

Setting up a validator or node from scratch can be time-consuming. To simplify this process, we offer **state sync services** and **snapshots** that enable fast setup. These resources ensure validators can:

-   **Recover quickly** from failures or crashes.
-   Join the network seamlessly without waiting for long sync times.

----------

### **4. Decentralization Map**

Our **Decentralization Map** offers a **visual representation of the validator nodes** across the network, providing critical insights into the geographical distribution of the network‚Äôs infrastructure. This tool helps:

-   **Track network health and distribution** in real-time.
-   Encourage further decentralization by highlighting underrepresented regions.

----------

### **5. Story Exporter**

To complement our monitoring solutions, we developed the **Story Exporter**, a custom tool that collects metrics from Story validators and exports them for **Prometheus and Grafana monitoring**. It gathers crucial data, including:

-   **Block production and consensus metrics**.
-   **Resource utilization and system health** through Node Exporter integration.
-   **Alerts for validator issues** like missed blocks or node downtime.

----------

### **6. Useful Commands and Validator Utilities**

We understand that validators need quick access to commands for managing their nodes. We provide a **comprehensive list of useful commands** to streamline node operations. Additionally, our **tool utility for Story protocol** offers features like:

-   **RPC endpoint health checks** for validating connectivity.
-   **Automated peer management** for improved uptime and stability.
-   **Monitoring utilities** to maintain validator performance and detect issues early.
