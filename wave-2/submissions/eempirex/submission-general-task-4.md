## Validator Status Telegram Bot

If you prefer using **Telegram** over **Discord**, this chatbot is here to help you monitor the status of your validator with ease. Simply type `/start` to begin and input your validator’s address. Use the `/check` command to view real-time status details about your validator.

You can access the bot [here](https://t.me/StoryEmpirexBot).

### Key Features:

- **Simple Commands**:

  - `/start`: Initializes the bot, prompting you to enter your validator’s address for tracking.
  - `/check`: Displays real-time status information for your validator, including key metrics (e.g., jailed, active, inactive).

- **Automatic Notifications**:  
  The bot will automatically send you updates when your validator’s status changes:
  - **Jailed**: The validator is penalized and temporarily removed from consensus or block production.
  - **Unjailed**: The validator is restored after being jailed.
  - **Active**: The validator is currently active and participating in the network consensus.
  - **Inactive**: The validator is not participating in block production or consensus.

This bot is perfect for busy individuals who want **real-time updates** on their validator's status without needing to check manually.
