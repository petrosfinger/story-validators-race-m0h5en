## Story Protocol Snapshots

Our team offers 2 types of snapshots:
1. Pruned (every 3 hours).
2. Archival (every 24 hours).

We have also developed a script for automatic installation, all you need to do is specify the names of your services for story and geth. And the script will automatically install the latest versions of the snapshots.
