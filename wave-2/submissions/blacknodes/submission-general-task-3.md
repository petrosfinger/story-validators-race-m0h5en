## Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into three main sections:

1. **Blockchain Overview** (8 panels)
2. **Consensus Metrics** (6 panels)
3. **Network Metrics** (2 panels)

### Key Metrics

- **Current Block Height**: Real-time tracking of the blockchain's progression
- **Block Production Rate**: Monitoring the speed and consistency of block creation

## Benefits for Story Blockchain

1. **Enhanced Visibility**: Provides a clear, at-a-glance view of the blockchain's current state and performance.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Helps validators identify and address issues that may impact block production or consensus.

3. **Network Health Monitoring**: Tracks peer connections and message rates, ensuring robust network communication.

4. **Consensus Monitoring**: Offers insights into validator participation, byzantine behavior, and consensus rounds, crucial for maintaining network integrity.

5. **Resource Management**: Monitors mempool size and transaction rates, helping optimize node resources.

6. **Historical Analysis**: Allows for trend analysis over time, aiding in capacity planning and performance tuning.

7. **Alerting Potential**: Can be configured to alert operators of unusual activities or performance issues.

## How to Use

1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Keep the dashboard open for continuous monitoring of the network's state.

2. **Performance Troubleshooting**: Use the Block Interval and Consensus Rounds panels to identify potential issues in block production.

3. **Network Analysis**: Monitor the Number of Peers and P2P Message Send Rate to ensure your node is well-connected.

4. **Validator Health Check**: Use the Number of Validators, Missing Validators, and Byzantine Validators gauges to track the overall health of the validator set.

5. **Transaction Monitoring**: Watch the Transaction Rate and Mempool Size to understand the network's current load.

6. **Blockchain Growth**: Track the Current Block Height and Block Size to monitor the blockchain's growth over time.
