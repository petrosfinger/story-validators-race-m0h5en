# Note

‼️ Important! Before you start doing tasks, create a data.json file at the path `wave-2/submissions/github_username/data.json`, where `github_username` is the name of your github username.</br>
</br>
`validator_address` - your validator address (valoper)</br>
`discord_id` - your discord id</br>
`discord_username` - your discord username</br>
</br>
In `data.json`, fill in the contents:
```
{
  "validator_address": "string",
  "discord_id": "number",
  "discord_username": "string"
}
```
After that, create a PR with the name: `Information file <validator_moniker>`
After successful completion of the task, test tokens will be sent to your EVM validator address.
