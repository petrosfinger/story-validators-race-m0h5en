## GovScan integration

[GovScan](https://govscan.live) is a governance tracking platform designed to streamline governance monitoring for validators and blockchain participants.\
It provides several valuable features:
- **Proposals Explorer**: Anyone can check the status of ongoing and past proposals within a protocol.

- **Notifications**: Users can subscribe to notifications for new governance proposals and receive updates on their status throughout the voting period. This helps validators stay informed about critical network upgrades and governance decisions.

- **In-App Voting**: Validators can cast their votes directly within the platform, making it easier for them to engage in governance without switching between tools.

- **Customizable Alerts**. Users can set the granularity of notifications they receive:
    - _New Proposal Alerts_: Users who are primarily interested in new governance decisions can opt to only receive notifications when a new proposal is created.

    - _Voting Milestones_: For those who want a more detailed tracking, GovScan can notify when key milestones are reached, such as when a proposal reaches the quorum needed to resolve.

    - _Proposal Outcome_: Users can choose to be additionally notified when a proposal ends, whether it passed or not.

To start using GovScan, all you need to do is:

1. **Sign up with your Gmail account**.

2. **Subscribe to the Story Network**.

3. **Set up your notification channel**: Choose your preferred notification channel, whether itâ€™s **Discord**, **Slack**, or **Telegram**
