2) APPLY A SNAPSHOT (Mandragora & others)
3) UPDATE TO A SPECIFIC VERSION
4) NODE STATUS
5) CHECK LOGS (STORY+GETH)
6) ADD SEEDS (Mandragora & others)

:key: We offer an automatic installation node script (it installs a basic and standard setup), multiple snapshot providers to make it more useful, as well as extra infrastructure configurations that may help during troubleshooting of bad peering or connectivity.
