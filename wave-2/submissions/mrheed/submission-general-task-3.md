## Grafana Monitoring Dashboard

The Grafana Monitoring Dashboard is a tool designed to help you visualize and monitor the performance and health of your Story Protocol node. It provides a view of various metrics and logs, enabling you to track the node's status and identify any potential issues quickly.

- **Config File**: The configuration file for the dashboard, [dashboard.json](https://github.com/Aldebaranode/monitoring-dashboard/blob/main/story/dashboard.json), contains all the necessary settings and layout information to set up your Grafana dashboard. You can download and import this file into your Grafana instance to get started.

- **Dashboard Site**: You can access the live Grafana Dashboard at [Grafana Dashboard](https://grafana.aldebaranode.xyz/story). This site provides a real-time view of the node's performance metrics, allowing you to monitor its operation effectively.
